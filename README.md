    * Manage invoice statuses (Draft, Sent, Paid, Partially Paid, Cancelled).
    * Add notes to invoices.
* **Invoice Details & PDF Export:**
    * View detailed information for individual invoices.
    * Generate and download professional PDF invoices using `html2canvas` and `jspdf`.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

* **Vue.js 3:** Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
* **Pinia:** Intuitive state management library for Vue.js.
* **Vue Router 4:** Official router for Vue.js.
* **Vuetify 3:** Vue UI Library with a Material Design component framework.
* **Vite:** Fast development build tool.
* **html2canvas:** Library to take screenshots of web pages or parts of them.
* **jsPDF:** Library to generate PDFs in JavaScript.
* **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

### Backend

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js:** Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **Google Sheets API (`googleapis`, `google-auth-library`):** Used for reading, writing, and updating data in Google Sheets, which serves as the database for the application.
* **`dotenv`:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
* **`cors`:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* **`uuid`:** For generating unique IDs (e.g., for clients, artists, and individual invoice items).

### Database

* **Google Sheets:** Utilized as a simple, accessible database for storing application data (Clients, Artists, Products and Services, Invoices, and Invoice Items).

## Project Structure

The repository is divided into two main directories:

* **`backend/`**: Contains the Node.js Express server that interacts with the Google Sheets API.
* **`frontend/`**: Contains the Vue.js 3 application that provides the user interface.

## Setup Instructions

### Notes!
Before starting the setup, you must install these first
* **`Git`**: https://git-scm.com/downloads
* **`Node.JS`**: https://nodejs.org/en (when install, don't check the additional stuff such as chocolatey!)

To get the Invoicez application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/secretceremony/invoicez
cd invoicez
```

### 2. Google Sheets API Setup

The backend uses a Google Service Account to access your Google Sheet.

1.  **Create a Google Service Account:**
    * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    * Create a new project or select an existing one.
    * Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."
    * Click "Create Credentials" > "Service account."
    * Follow the steps to create a new service account. Grant it the "Google Sheets API Editor" role or a custom role with equivalent permissions to read and write to Google Sheets.
    * After creation, click on the service account email, then go to the "Keys" tab, click "Add Key" > "Create new key," and select "JSON." This will download a JSON key file.
    * **Place this JSON file** in the `backend/` directory of your project.

2.  **Share your Google Sheet with the Service Account:**
    * Create a new Google Sheet that will store your invoice data. You'll need separate tabs (sheets) named `Clients`, `Artists`, `ProductsAndServices`, `Invoices`, and `InvoiceItems`.
    * The first row of each sheet should contain the headers as expected by the backend:
        * **Clients**: `ID`, `Name`, `Contact`
        * **Artists**: `ID`, `Name`, `NIM`, `Role`, `Contact`
        * **ProductsAndServices**: `ID`, `Name`, `Description`, `UnitPrice`, `Category`
        * **Invoices**: `ID`, `InvoiceType`, `Date`, `ClientID`, `ArtistID`, `Subtotal`, `DownPaymentAmount`, `TotalDue`, `Status`, `Notes`
        * **InvoiceItems**: `ID`, `InvoiceID`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `LineTotal`, `PurchaseLocation` 
    * **Share this Google Sheet** with the email address of your newly created service account (e.g., `your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`). Grant it "Editor" access.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * In the `backend/` directory, create a file named `.env`.
    * Add the following variables to it, replacing the placeholders with your actual Spreadsheet ID and service account key file path:

    ```env
    PORT=3000
    SPREADSHEET_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./thermal-origin-462809-t2-3ab93a986931.json
    ```
    * **Note:** The `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` should be relative to the `backend/` directory.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to both the `backend/` and `frontend/` directories and install their respective dependencies:

```bash
# For the backend
cd backend
npm install

# For the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Application

#### Start the Backend Server

Navigate back to the `backend/` directory and start the server:

```bash
cd backend/
node server.js
# You should see: Backend server running on port 3000
# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

The backend server will listen on `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Start the Frontend Application

Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend/` directory, and start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend/
npm run dev
# You should see output similar to:
# VITE v6.x.x ready in Xms
# âžœ Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:5173`.

### 5. Access the Application

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to access the Invoice Manager.

### (Optional) Access both applications at the same time

you can use `.bat` file for local developing. you only need these files with this code onto your folder and you can make a shortcut to the main `.bat` file

main.bat
```bash
@echo off
start frontend.bat
start backend.bat
```

frontend.bat
```bash
cd C:\Users\(your PC username)\invoicez\frontend
npm run dev
```

backend.bat
```bash
cd C:\Users\(your PC username)\invoicez\backend
node server.js
```

## Important Notes & Troubleshooting

* **CORS Issues:** If you encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors, ensure your backend's `cors` middleware is correctly configured to allow requests from your frontend's origin (`http://localhost:5173`).
* **Google Sheets API Errors:** If the application fails to fetch or save data, check the backend console for errors related to the Google Sheets API. Common issues include incorrect `SPREADSHEET_ID`, `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH`, or the service account not having sufficient permissions or not being shared with the Google Sheet.
* **Invoice Item Catalog:** The current `itemCatalog.js` in the frontend attempts to derive a master list of items from existing invoices, which can be inefficient. For a large number of invoice items, it is recommended to add a dedicated backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/all-invoice-items`) that directly reads all entries from the `InvoiceItems` sheet.
* **Security:** The `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` in the `.env` file and the JSON key file itself should be kept strictly confidential and never committed to public repositories. ~~The `.gitignore` files are configured to prevent this.~~ for now we are still figuring out how to use the key without uploading `.json` file. the best way is by using Github Actions Workflow, OICD, and GCP Workload Identity Federation (read here: https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth)
* **PDF Generation:** The PDF generation relies on `html2canvas` and `jspdf`. Complex CSS layouts might sometimes render imperfectly in the PDF. Adjustments to CSS or `html2canvas` options (like `scale`) might be necessary for optimal output.
